Before jumping to the [global architecture view](./GLOBAL.MD) we recommand to read about the [main concepts](./DOMAINMODEL.MD) of Weacast. 

You can then have a look to:
* the [component-oriented view](./COMPONENTS.MD) of the architecture
* the [data model-oriented view](./DATAMODEL.MD) of the architecture
* the [dynamic view](./DYNAMIC.MD) of the architecture
