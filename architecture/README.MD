Before jumping to the [global architecture view](./GLOBAL.MD) we recommand to read about the [main concepts](./DOMAINMODEL.MD) of Weacast. You might also prefer to have a:
* [component-oriented view](./COMPONENTS.MD) of the architecture
* [data model-oriented view](./DATAMODEL.MD) of the architecture
