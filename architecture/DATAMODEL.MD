# Data model-oriented view of the architecture

> According to Feathers philosophy each data model is manipulated using a [service interface](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/services.html) to perform [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete).

## Forecast data model

Weacast aims at gathering, exposing, and making use of weather forecast data generated by **forecast models**. It does often exist different **instances** of a forecast model producing more or less accurate data, usually in term of spatial or temporal resolution. As an example the [GFS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs) model produces data at 1° or 0.5° degree of resolution with different time steps (e.g. each 3 hours until the production time + 240 hours). The production of a set of forecast data is called a **run** of the model and occurs on a regular daily basis, e.g. every 6 hours.

The properties of a forecast model instance is described by the following data model:

This data model is instanciated from the [configuration](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/guides/BASICS.html#configuring) and manipulated through the [Forecast model API](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/api/FORECAST.html). The spatial properties of a model instance are completely defined by a [grid](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/api/GRID.html). The temporal properties are defined by interval values describing at which frequency/time the forecast data are produced (so called **run interval/time**) and which time steps are available (so called **forecast interval/time**).

## Element data model

Each configured forecast model instance output hundreds of forecast elements (i.e. meteorological elements) such as temperature, wind direction, etc. Forecast data are continuously updated because the model instance produces new forecast element data every N hours. The properties of a forecast element is described by the following data model:

This data model is instanciated when forecast data are gathered by [Forecast model plugins](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/api/PLUGIN.html) and manipulated through the [Forecast element API](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/api/ELEMENT.html).
