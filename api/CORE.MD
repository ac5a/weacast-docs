# Core API

## Forecast

Weacast exposes the available forecast models found in the [configuration](../guides/BASICS.MD#configuring) at startup through the `forecasts` service. Although only web sockets are used on the client side, both the [REST](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/rest.html) and the [Socket](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/socketio.html) interfaces are configured.
